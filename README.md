# Automated Product Description Generation

## Overview

Automate the process of updating product descriptions on websites with the help of web scraping and Large Language Model (LLM) APIs. This project streamlines the creation of accurate and concise product descriptions by extracting information from provided URLs and utilizing pre-trained LLMs via their APIs.

## Approach

### Web Scraping:
Utilize Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy to extract product details from URLs.

### LLM APIs:
Leverage OpenAI GPT API or similar pre-trained LLMs to generate succinct descriptions directly from the extracted content.

### Search API Integration:
Enhance the accuracy of descriptions by integrating external data through APIs such as Google Custom Search API or similar services.
